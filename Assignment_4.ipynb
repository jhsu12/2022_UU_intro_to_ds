    "This time the assignment only consists of one problem, but we will do a more comprehensive analysis instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the dataset `mammography.mat` that you can download from [http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/mammography-dataset/](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/mammography-dataset/). Below you can find the code to load this file into `X` and `Y`, you just need to put the file in your `data` folder. During mammography the doctor would be looking for something called `calcification`, which is calcium deposits in the breast tissue and is used as an indicator of cancer. In this dataset the `X` corresponds to some measurements, there are 6 features. The `Y` is a 0-1 label where 1 represents calcification and 0 does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [3p] Split the data into three parts, train/test/validation where train is 60% of the data, test is 15% and validation is 25% of the data. Do not do this randomly, I have prepared a shuffling with a fixed seed, this way I can make sure that we all did the same splits. That is [train,test,validation] is the splitting layout.\n",
    "2. [4p] Train a machine learning model on the training data (you are free to choose it yourself). Hint: you could always try `LogisticRegression`, but for it to work well you would need `StandardScaler` and put everything in a `Pipeline`.\n",
    "3. [3p] Use the classification report from `Utils` and compute the intervals for precision-recall etc on the test set with `union_bound correction` with 95% confidence.\n",
    "4. [3p] You are interested in minimizing the average cost of your classifier, but first we must define it:\n",
    "    * If someone is calcified but classified as not, we say it costs 30 **(this is the worst scenario)** \n",
    "    * If someone is not calcified but classified as calcified, we say it costs 5 **(this probably only costs extra investigation)**\n",
    "    * If someone is calcified but classified as calcified, costs 0 **(We did the right thing, no cost)**\n",
    "    * If someone is not calcified but classified as not, costs 0 **(We did the right thing, no cost)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "complete filling the function `cost` to compute the cost of a prediction model under a certain prediction threshold (recall our precision recall lecture and the `predict_proba` function from trained models). What would be the cost of having a model that always classifies someone as not calcified on the test set?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [4p] Now, we wish to select the threshold of our classifier that minimizes the cost, we do that by checking say 100 evenly spaced proposal thresholds between 0 and 1, and use our testing data to compute the cost.\n",
    "6. [4p] With your newly computed threshold value, compute the cost of putting this model in production by computing the cost using the validation data. Also provide a confidence interval of the cost using Hoeffdings inequality with a 95% confidence.\n",
    "7. [3p] Let $t$ be the threshold you found and $f$ the model you fitted, if we define the random variable\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    C = 30(1-1_{f(X)\\geq t})Y+5(1-Y)1_{f(X) \\geq t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "then $C$ denotes the cost of a randomly chosen patient. In the above we are estimating $\\mathbb{E}[C]$ using the empirical mean. However, since the number of calcifications in the population is fairly small and our classifier probably has a fairly high precision for the $0$ class, then $C$ should have fairly small variance. Compute the empirical variance of $C$ on the validation set. What would be the confidence interval if we used Bennett's inequality instead of Hoeffding in point 6 but with the computed empirical variance as our guess for the variance?"
